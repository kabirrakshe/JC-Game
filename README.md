A julius caesar card game that sacrificed my sleep.

This game is based off the play “The Tragedy of Julius Caesar”. We made a spin-off of the plot where Caesar fights back in order to achieve victory. In the original story, Caesar dies without a chance to fight back.

Each player gets 3 moves before their turn ends and the decks switch sides for the opponent's turn

Moves can do the following:
- Attack an opponent by selecting one card from their deck to attack a card from opponent's deck
- Draw a card (Power Ups are Heal and Arrows) 
- Each card has a certain amount of hp. Keep an eye on your characters or else they will perish.



Casca/Brutus: Stabs (True to the story of Julius’s historical death)
- Archers: Arrow Shots (reduces health of target card)
- Antony: Vanquish (Halves the health of target card)
- Cinna: Bribery (50% Chance of target enemy's death/ 50% chance of own death)
- Decius: Betrayal (Switches with target card)
- Soothsayer: Steal (Uses a target card's power against themselves)
- Calphurnia: Seduce (Trade health bars with target card)

Powerups:
Bandages increase your selected card's hp
Arrows decrease selected opponent card's hp
